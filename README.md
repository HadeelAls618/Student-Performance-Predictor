# Complete Machine Learning Project with MLOps and CI/CD Pipelines

This project demonstrates the entire lifecycle of a machine learning application, starting from data ingestion to deploying the model into production. It employs best practices for MLOps and leverages various tools and platforms for automation, scalability, and reliability.

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. **Data Ingestion and Transformation Pipeline**
- Built a robust pipeline to handle data ingestion from various sources.
- Performed necessary transformations such as data cleaning, missing value imputation, feature engineering, and scaling.
- Ensured reproducibility and scalability of the pipeline for handling large datasets.

### 2. **Model Training Pipeline**
- Designed and implemented a machine learning model training pipeline.
- Incorporated hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation metrics to ensure optimal performance.
- Saved the trained model artifacts in a structured and accessible manner for deployment.

### 3. **Model Deployment**
- Utilized Flask to create an API endpoint for serving the model.
- Deployed the Flask application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for scalability and ease of access.
- Ensured the application could handle concurrent requests and return predictions efficiently.

### 4. **Production and CI/CD Pipeline**
- Developed a CI/CD pipeline for automating the build, test, and deployment processes using:
  - **Docker**: For containerizing the application and ensuring consistency across environments.
  - **AWS ECR**: To store Docker images securely.
  - **AWS EC2**: For hosting and running the application in a production environment.
  - **GitHub Actions**: For automating the CI/CD pipeline and ensuring smooth deployment workflows.
- Enabled monitoring and logging to identify and address issues proactively in the production environment.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, etc.
- **MLOps Tools**: Docker, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, ECR, EC2), GitHub Actions
- **Version Control**: Git
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Docker, AWS, GitHub Actions
